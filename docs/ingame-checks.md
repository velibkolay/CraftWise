# In-game checks

Things the headless tests cannot prove. Run after installing, in the Forever beta.

## Setup
1. Install CraftWise and Auctionator, `/reload`.
2. Auction house: Auctionator tab, **Full Scan**.

## Recipe capture (#1, #3)
- [ ] Open a profession window. `/cw debug` shows the profession with a recipe count that includes unlearned recipes.
- [ ] Count matches the window with the "Unlearned" filter on. If it only counts learned recipes, `GetAllRecipeIDs` respects the filter: report it.
- [ ] `/cw`: unlearned recipes show reagents (tooltip). If they show "Reagents unknown", `GetRecipeSchematic` returns nothing for unlearned recipes.

## Prices (#2)
- [ ] Rows show cost and sells-for after the Auctionator scan.
- [ ] Visit a trade goods vendor (thread, dye) and reopen `/cw`: those reagents show "vendor" in the tooltip.
- [ ] Without Auctionator: orange warning line, no Lua error.

## Trainer (#3)
- [ ] Open the profession window first (recipe names are matched against it), then your profession trainer, then `/cw`: trainer recipes show Trainable / Trainable at N, a learn cost and break-even.

## UI (#5)
- [ ] Window drags, closes with Esc and the X button.
- [ ] Profession buttons switch tables; "Show unlearned" toggles rows.
- [ ] Header click sorts, second click flips direction.
- [ ] Vendor recipe tooltip: own-faction vendors first, other faction in blue with "(Horde)"/"(Alliance)". "My faction only" hides recipes sold only by the other faction. Try on a Horde and an Alliance character.
- [ ] Mouse wheel scrolls; Shift+wheel scrolls a page.
- [ ] Row hover: reagent breakdown with source; clicking a row with the profession open selects the recipe.
